## Analysis All Participants 

### Null (unconditional) model

```{r}
d.Null <- lme(DV~1,random=~1|Case,data=data,
control=list(opt="optim"),na.action="na.omit")
coefficients(d.Null)
intervals(d.Null)
summary(d.Null)
```


### Model with random intercept and change in level (with an autocorrelation component)
```{r}
d.Level <- lme(DV~1+Phase,random=~1|Case,data=data,
correlation=corAR1(form=~1|Case),control=list(opt="optim"),na.action="na.omit")
coefficients(d.Level)
intervals(d.Level)
summary(d.Level)
```


### Model with random intercept and change in slope (with an autocorrelation component)
```{r}
d.Time <- lme(DV~1+Time_CTR,random=~1|Case,data=data,
correlation=corAR1(form=~1|Case),control=list(opt="optim"),na.action="na.omit")
# Rename variables and use only complete cases
coefficients(d.Time)
intervals(d.Time)
summary(d.Time)
```


### Model with random intercept and change in level/slope in Tx (with autocorrelation)
```{r}
d.Model <- lme(DV~1+Phase+Time_PhaseCTR,random=~1|Case,data=data,
correlation=corAR1(form=~1|Case),control=list(opt="optim"),na.action="na.omit")

# Rename variables and use only complete cases
coefficients(d.Model)
intervals(d.Model)
summary(d.Model)
```

### Results


| **Value** | **Score** | **_p_-Value** |
| :-------- | :-------: | :-----------: |
| Autocorrelation     | .494      |  |
| Level | 10.17      | .177 |
| Slope | 1.84     |  .337    |


Although the effect size is rather large, it is not significant. Additionally, the obtained change in slope between phases is not significant. This does not necessarily suggest a functional relation cannot be determined. As defined in Carter (2013): _effect size_ does not imply causation and effect sizes are independent of demonstrations of experimental control. I think this is worth taking into consideration when comparing this calculation to the visual analysis and Tau-U.

With Participant 3 removed, the obtained status tracking data from Participants 1 and 2 generate a very large effect with a *p*-value less than .05. This provides further evidence that Participants 1 and 2 responded to the intervention and demonstrated a significant change in level between the baseline and experimental phases.
