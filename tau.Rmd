## Results 

| **Value** | **Score** |
| :-------- | :-------: |
| Tau-U     | .605      |
| *z*-Score | 2.93      |
| *p*-value | .0034     | 

The [Single Case Research free calculator](http://www.singlecaseresearch.org/) was utilized to calculate the Tau-U effect size. The first and second participants required a baseline trend correction. The weighted Tau-U score was determined to be .605 with a z-score of 2.93 and p-value of .0034, suggesting a moderate effect. The Tau-U calculation appears to support a treatment effect while visual analysis and MLM do not appear to strongly support a functional relation.
